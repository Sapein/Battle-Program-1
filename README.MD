Hello and welcome to my little Battle Program, right now it doesn't work properly, and I"m not done. However I felt like releasing the source for this so here it is, this is licensed under the MIT license.

Essentially Battle Program 1 is designed to be a test of Text-based battle system implimentation. 

(btw tc.exe is a compiling script for testing, I'm just to lazy to move it at this time. Also yes, I work on Windows). 

Have Fun!
